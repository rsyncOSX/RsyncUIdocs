RsyncUI is a pure *SwiftUI* based macOS application utilizing the command line tool `rsync` for synchronizing files. It is `rsync` which executes the real synchronizing task, not RsyncUI. RsyncUI is a GUI only on top of rsync. RsyncUI is signed and notarized by Apple.  

Check out  [the categories](/categories)  for information about other topics not linked to on this page. RsyncUI is built for *macOS Sonoma* only.

## Before commencing use of RsyncUI

See [the changelog](/post/changelog/) for updates. RsyncUI is built as a Universal macOS Binary, which means it runs nativly on Apple Silicon and Intel-based Mac computers.  RsyncUI can be installed by Homebrew by command

```bash
brew install --cask rsyncui
```
or by  [download from GitHub](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/releases). If installed by Homebrew, the shasum is automatically verified. If downloaded from GitHub please verify the shasum.

## Remote servers, passwordless logins and local disks

RsyncUI can synchronize your data to remote servers on the Internet, servers on your local LAN and to local attached disk. If you only want to synchronize data to a local attached disk, connect the disk, add source and destination and you are ready for your first task. If you want to synchronize data to a server there is some more setup to do. If you have enabled passwordless login by ssh you only have to add login id, servername, source and destination and you are ready to synchronize. If you have not enabled passwordless login, there are some more actions required before your first task.

## New users

The first time RsyncUI starts, it presents a link to [important](/post/important/) information. There is also info about the [latest version of rsync](/post/rsync/) to install.

RsyncUI can be used in parallel with RsyncOSX. The catalog for storing configuration files is `$HOME/.rsyncosx/macserialnumber/`. RsyncUI and RsyncOSX do not share user settings, e.g, like enabling version 3.x of rsync, has to be set in both apps.

## Aborting a task

Please be aware it is an external task not controlled by RsyncUI, which executes the command line tool `rsync`. RsyncUI is monitoring the task for progress and termination. The user can at any time abort a task. Please let the abort to finish and cleanup properly before starting a new task. It might take a few seconds. If not, the apps might become unresponsive.

## RsyncUI vs RsyncOSX

Which application should I use? Both applications do the same job, but RsyncUI is more feature-rich, and the GUI, including navigation, is better. **Are you on macOS Sonoma?** Go for RsyncUI. And for the last year and years to come, all development has been and will be within RsyncUI. RsyncOSX is maintained, but only for bug fixes. There is some info about how [RsyncUI is built](/post/built/).

## New tasks, verify task and synchronizing data

After  [adding](/post/addconfigurations/) a task within the main view,  *a double click* on [task](/post/tasks/) executes a dryrun and the second double click executes the real run. A verification of a new task might also be executed by opening the Rsync parameters view, selecting the task and choosing the Verify button.

For more experienced users of rsync, from within the Rsync parameters view, select the new task. Copy and paste the *synchronization* string into a terminal view. The rsync command includes the `--dry-run` parameter as default within this view. Always verify, by a `--dry-run`, the result of a new task before executing it.
