*Under development.* This page is an overview of the main components of RsyncUI and some of RsyncOSX as well. The development of the apps has been an evolving process. The open source community has been and still is a great resource for ideas and how to solve specific tasks. Both apps today are stable and in a state of maintenance. Some numbers:

| App      | Lines of code | Swift files | Version 1.0 |
| ----------- | ----------- |   ----------- | -------- |
| RsyncUI   | about 13.6K     | about 162       | 6 May 2021 |
| RsyncOSX   | about 11K   | about 121      | 14 March 2016 |	

Which application should I use? Both applications do the same job, but RsynUI is more feature-rich, and the GUI, including navigation, is better. **Are you on macOS Sonoma?** Go for RsyncUI. And for the last year and years to come, all development has been and will be within RsyncUI. RsyncOSX is maintained, but only for bug fixes.

# A few words about the code

Even though I am an educated IT person, most of my professional work has been as an IT manager and not a developer. Most of my coding experience is with private projects such as RsyncOSX and RsyncUI. Google is and has been a great resource for research and advice on how to solve specific problems. Reading about other developers code and discussions is always valuable input for me. The MVC pattern and single source of truth are important patterns for both apps. I have also tried to use all Apple Frameworks, utilizing most of the required built-in functions, like sorting or filter algorithms. And even if there are many lines of code in both apps, I have tried to write as little code as possible. So if you are looking at my code, keep this in mind, my code is only one of probably many ways to solve a problem.

There is only some info further about RsyncOSX. RsyncOSX is stable for many years and it does the job. But parts of the source code is due for a revision and rewrite. The future is RsyncUI and source code in RsyncOSX is frozen. Only bugs are fixed. All ideas about QA and changes of code in RsyncOSX is implemented in RsyncUI. 

# Why not App Store

One important requirement for macOS apps on Apple App Store is, quote Apple: *"To distribute a macOS app through the Mac App Store, you must enable the App Sandbox capability."* There are restrictions what an app can do inside the App Sandbox and one restriction is not allowed to access local .dotfiles outside catalogs like the Documents catalog. One important feature for RsyncUI is passwordless login by ssh to remote servers. Passwordless login by ssh is by ssh-keys and default ssh-key is:
```bash
~/.ssh/id_rsa
```
The App Sandbox capability is set off and access local files on. This is the only way to get RsyncUI working as expected. In theory I could make a version for local attached disks only and using SwiftData only. But then there is two versions again which are difficult to keep in sync. The sequrity for RsyncUI is the app is Notarized and Signed by Apple. 

# RsyncUI vs RsyncOSX

For the moment, there are more users of RsyncOSX than of RsyncUI. But the number of users of RsyncUI is growing. And Apple is clear: *SwiftUI*, which RsyncUI is developed by, is the future. This means new development is on RsyncUI. RsyncOSX is still maintained, but only issues have been fixed. RsyncUI and RsyncOSX share most of the code for the model components. The main differences between the two apps are the user interface (UI) and how the UI is built. Both apps utilise another great declarative library, Combine, developed by Apple, and JSON files for storing tasks, log records, and user configuration.

| App      | UI | Paradigm |
| ----------- | ----------- |   ----------- |
| RsyncUI   | SwiftUI, Swift | declarativ  |
| RsyncOSX   | Storyboard, Swift  | imperativ |

SwiftUI is the latest declarative framework developed by Apple for views, controls, and layout structures for user interface. 

# RsyncOSX

There is only some info [about RsyncOSX and built info](/post/builtrsyncosx/).

# SwiftUI

*RsyncUI* utilizes *SwiftUI* for the UI. UI components are views, which is a value type `struct` and not a reference type `class`. UI components are added to RsyncUI by code. Every time a property within a SwiftUI view is changed the view is recreated by the runtime. In SwitfUI there are property wrappers to create bindings to mutable properties.

# Asynchronous execution 

Asynchronous execution of tasks are key components of both apps. Every time a `rsync` synchronize and restore task is executed the termination of the task is not known ahead.  When the *termination signal* is observed some actions are required. Some actions are like stopping a progressview, send a message about task is completed, do some logging and execute next synchronize task.

There are two methods for asynchronous execution. *Callback functions* or *completion handlers*, which trigger next action when task is completed, and SwiftÂ´s `async` and `await` keywords for asynchronous execution. Utilizing `async` and `await` makes the code simpler and cleaner. The need for *completion handlers* are reduced.  And lesser code is better code. 

Swift concurrency is a seperate and huge topic to discuss. I dont have the details and knowlegde to discuss it. There are structured and unstructered concurrency in Swift. Within RsyncUI and RsyncOSX there is only one asynchronous execution at any time except for concurrency within the Swift and SwiftUI libraries such as GUI updates. 

All code which utilizes asynchronous execution are shared between the two apps. The `Process` object is where the real work is done. Input to the `Process` are the command to execute and the parameters for the command. The `Process` object utilizes Combine for monitoring *process termination* and output, when needed by the apps, from the command.  There are two versions of the process object:

- [the process object](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/blob/main/RsyncUI/Model/Process/Main/RsyncProcess.swift)
- [the async process object](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/blob/main/RsyncUI/Model/Process/Main/Async/RsyncProcessAsync.swift)

The difference between those two objects are minor, the async version marks the function for execution with keyword `async`. Calling the `async` require the `await` keyword. 

# The Process object

Without communicating to the macOS system, RsyncUI is *nothing*. Every command within RsyncUI, except administration of tasks and logs, are commands to be executed by the macOS system. The main commands are executing `rsync` with the approriate arguments. But there are also commands executing `rm`, `ssh` and `mkdir`. And the Process object is utilized for all those commands. 

# Combine

Combine, a *declarative* library by Apple, makes the code easy to write and easy to read. In the Combine code for encode and write data to JSON file, the publisher require *macOS BigSur* and later. The following are examples of utilizing Combine:

- [read](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/blob/main/RsyncUI/Model/Storage/ReadConfigurationJSON.swift) configurations for tasks
- [write](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/blob/main/RsyncUI/Model/Storage/WriteConfigurationJSON.swift) configurations for tasks
- [the process object](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/blob/main/RsyncUI/Model/Process/Main/Async/RsyncProcessAsync.swift) for executing tasks
- debouncing input from user

# Start of RsyncUI

The start of RsyncUI conforms to the [App protocol](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/App). There is only one entrance point, `@main`, in RsyncUI. The `@main` initialises the app, setup of the menubar, and opens the navigation bar which is the main user start for the app.

# The model

Parts of the model is equal, but there are some differences due to the fact that SwiftUI views are *value types*, structs, and not *reference types*, classes, as in Storyboard and Swift. The model is also responsible for informing the views when there are changes. Both apps share basic functions like reading and writing data from the store, updating the model, and so on. The memory footprint of tasks is minimal. Data for tasks are kept in memory for both apps during their lifetime. The memory footprint for logs will grow over time as new logs are created and stored. But logs are only read from the store when viewing and deleting logs. When data about logs is not used, the data is released from memory to keep the memory as low as possible.

# Property wrapper for objects

With Swift 5.9, Xcode 15 and macOS 14 Apple introduced the `@Observable` macro. On previous macOS versions, the property wrapper `@StateObject` in combination with `ObservableObject` and Combine, are used to create binding to mutable properties. The new macro simplifies how to create bindings and there is also quite a boost in performance. The performance part is not that important for RsyncUI, but lesser code is better code.  There is also a new `@Bindable` property wrapper which create bindings to mutable properties of `@Observable` objects. 

# Environment property

Data for tasks are read from store and made available for all the views by an Environment property. After the app is initialized and started, it opens the main navigation and read tasks for the default profile and other profiles when selected. Data for tasks is made available for all views  within the view hierarchy by the `.environment` property on *macOS Sonoma* and  by the `.environmentObject` property on previous versions of macOS. The property makes the data global available for views. The `@Bindable` property wrapper is also, on macOS Sonoma, used for creating bindings to the mutable properties of `@Observable` objects.

All synchronize tasks are executed asynchron. The process object, which is responsible for executing the external rsync tasks, is listening for termination of the external process.  A `@State` object on macOS Sonoma, which is created when the SwiftUI view for observing the progress is created, is by the model updated during progress of the task.

# Breaking change

The `@Observable` macro is a breaking change. It is not possible to include the new macro in code and support older macOS versions as Monterey and Ventura. There are also som other changes and new properties which also makes it difficult to include new features in code and still support previous versions of macOS. The new Observation framework is a new implementation of the observer design pattern and removes the need for including Combine. Combine itself is still used in the RsyncUI.

# Combine and SwiftUI

There is no need for Combine in combination with the new  `@Observable` macro, but Combine is used in a couple of SwiftUI views to debounce text input from the user. The user input is a search or filter string and by default the userinput is a `@State` string variable. The view reacts on the input by every keypress and the filter algorithm is triggered by every keypress. This causes a sluggish user interface, but by debounce input by *one second* causes the filter algorithm only update after the *one second* debounce.

# OSLog

Included in Swift 5 there is a unified logging feature `OSLog`. There are several methods for logging and investigate what the application is up to. By using OSLog there is no need for print statements to follow execution. All logging is by utilizing OSLog displayed as part of Xcode. The `Process` objects are where all the real work is done. OSLog is  included in all objects which perform work and it is very easy to check which commands RsyncUI are executing.

OSLog info in Xcode. The logging is displaying commands and arguments as shown below. It makes it convenient to check that RsyncUI is executing the correct command.

And the OSLogs might be read by using the Console app. Be sure to set the Action in Console app menu to `Include Info Messages` and enter `no.blogspot.RsyncUI` as subsystem within the search field.

# Navigation

The main navigation, when RsyncUI starts, is by a `NavigationSplitView`: *A view that presents views in two or three columns, where selections in leading columns control presentations in subsequent columns.* RsyncUI utilizes two columns. Left column for main functions and the right column for details about each main function.  The details part is computed every time the user select a function like the Synchronize view, Tasks view and so on. The navigation within usersetting is also by `NavigationSplitView`.

Navigation within **all** view is by `NavigationStack`: "*A view that displays a root view and enables you to present additional views over the root view*".  One root view is the tasks view, and the all other views like estimating details, execution of tasks and so on will be presented ontop of the root view. RsyncUI utilizes two APIs of  `NavigationStack`:

The additional view is one view only and it is presented when `$somestate` becomes true.

```bash
@State private var somestate: Bool = false

var body: some View {
 	NavigationStack {
 		...
 		.navigationDestination(isPresented: $somestate) {
                SomeView()
            }
        }
    }
```

The views ontop of the root view are computed depended upon what the user decides to do. Like with the main tasks view, selecting estimate all, push the enum which represent start estimate onto the path and the `NavigationStack` loads that view ontop of the root view.

```bash
@State var path: [Tasks] = []
 
var body: some View {
	NavigationStack(path: $path) {
		...
		.navigationDestination(for: Tasks.self) { which in
                    makeView(view: which.task)
            }
        }
        
    @ViewBuilder
    func makeView(view: DestinationView) -> some View {
        switch view {
        case .executestimatedview:
            ExecuteEstimatedTasksView(selecteduuids: $selecteduuids,
                                      reload: $reload,
                                      path: $path)
                .environmentObject(executeprogressdetails)
        case .executenoestimatetasksview:
           ...
        case .estimatedview:
           ...
        }
    }
}
 
 enum DestinationView: String, Identifiable {
    case executestimatedview, executenoestimatetasksview,
         estimatedview, firsttime, dryrunonetask, alltasksview,
         dryrunonetaskalreadyestimated, viewlogfile
    var id: String { rawValue }
}

struct Tasks: Hashable, Identifiable {
    let id = UUID()
    var task: DestinationView
}
```
