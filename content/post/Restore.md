A restore should always be executed carefully. There is always a possibilty to delete or replace newer files with older when executing a restore. It is **only allowed** to do a restore to a temporary restore catalog. To set a temporary restore path [select userconfiguration](/post/userconfiguration/) and set `temporary path restore`.

There are two types of restore:

- full restore
  - if the remote (destination) is a snapshot the Full restore is from the latest snapshot
- restore files
  - if the remote (destination) is a snapshot the file list might be huge, depends upon how many snapshots and how many files in a snapshot
  - any file from any snapshot might be restored

Step one in a restore is to select from which configuration a restore is to be executed.

To do a restore, either full or by file, an estimation is normally required. The status light changes from red to yellow when an estimation can be executed. The status light is green when a restore can be executed.

You can restore single file or catalogs by a double click in the right table, if restore by files are selected and RsyncOSX has retrieved file list from remote location.

## Full restore

A full restore might be restored to the original source catalog on the Mac. It is not advised to do so. Always execute a restore to the temporary restore path.

The button `Do the real thing:` must be checked before a restore can be executed (after an estimation run). If not only a simulation message is shown.

## Restore files

To restore files or catalogs select the restore by file button. RsyncOSX retrieves files from remote location. Select either a file or catalog, execute an `Estimate` and then a `Restore`. A double click on a file or catalog in right table will execute a restore right away.
