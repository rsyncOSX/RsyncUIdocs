RsyncUI is [signed and notarized](/post/notarized/) and built as [Universal macOS Binary](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/building_a_universal_macos_binary).  If you miss some functions please drop me an email: thomeven@gmail.com or create an Issue on GitHub. All suggestions about enhancements are welcome.

## Version 1.8.5 (build 93) - 23 January 2024

Work in progress, summarized:

- internal naming of logrecords and physical file for saving are changed
	- this is a somewhat big internal change
	- data from old file logrecords are automatically saved by new filename, including for profiles if profiles is used
- user settings now discover if parameters and data is changed and autosaves if changed, no need for explicit save changes
- there is now a possibility to load demo data, loading demodata creates a *DemoData* profile and copy demodata from the RsyncUI GitHub repository
- Confetti in FirsTime view is removed due to a bug in external code for Confetti

Some details:

The internal naming of logrecords in the model in RsyncUI, including the physical file for saving logrecords, is changed to support understanding of what it is. Much of the model part was imported from RsyncOSX, and due to the history of RsyncOSX, the naming in RsyncUI was inconvenient. RsyncUI takes care of automatically copying and creating new files for log records. The change is a kind of *breaking* change; you have to choose either to use RsyncUI or RsyncOSX. Not both. My advice is, of course, to use RsyncUI.

There is a bug in the Confetti view and the FirstTime view for new users of RsyncUI. The bug is not resolved, and the Confetti is removed from RsyncUI. Confetti was an external package imported into RsyncUI.

## SwiftData

*SwiftData* - I have commenced the work in this release to see if SwiftData might be beneficial for RsyncUI. There are only three files saved to storage from RsyncUI, tasks, log records and user settings. Those data might be enabled to utilize SwiftData and if so RsyncUI might be available from the Apple App Store as well. This is due to App Sandbox capability and what is allowed and not allowed inside an App Sandbox. Reading and writing files from a `.dotcatalog` on a users home directory is not allowed which RsyncUI does now. The work is commenced. What is requiered first is to update the internal dataflow before introducing SwiftData for RsyncUI.

If a *SwiftData* version is enabled, there will be two versions of RsyncUI, one for Homebrew as today and one for the App Store utlizing only attached discs and default version of rsync. I have just commenced learning about SwifData and a new version might be ready sometime late in February or March 2024.

- the work on *SwiftData* is commenced, but I have to study what and understand how to use it myself
	- if success on SwiftData there might be a minor version of RsyncUI on App Store, by minor means only default version of rsync on macOS and attached disks only
	- the full version of RsyncUI will always be available on Homebrew

## Version 1.8.2 (build 92) - 8 January 2024

This is maintenance release including a few minor enhancements: 

- cleanup and remove duplicates in code
- fixed some toolbar actions and updated some of the icons on the toolbar
- new filtersearch in snapshots
- converted the last `ObservableObject` with the new `Observation` macro
	- property wrapper to create binding to mutable properties in SwiftUI
- the new `ContentUnavailableView` is used to inform when there are no match for filter search
	- there are filter search in tasks, logrecords and snapshots
- and fixed a couple of minor bugs as well

If you hoover the mouse over a toolbar icon, it will display a short message about which function is behind the icon. Just give it a second to display the message.

## Version 1.8.1 (build 91) - 29 December 2023

There are a few more minor GUI enhancements and tweaks. And cleaning of code, remove unused code and updates where needed. 

- the adding tasks includes a list of all catalogs from your `$Home` catalog, if there is attached a drive the volume name is automatically copied to destination
- a new confirm dialog if number of files to synchronize is like a new task
	- sometimes a remote server or local disk is unavailable, if you commence a synchronize task unaware of destination resource is not available, rsync might believe this is a new full synchronize and a dialog confirms synchronize or abort
	- the feature to be switch on off in usersettings
	- if a remote server is unavailable rsync will *most likely* complain and throw an error, if `check for error in output` in user settings is enabled, the rsync error messages written to log and an Alert informing about it will occur
	- if a local disk is not attached rsync will try to synchronize data to `/Volumes/` catalog on your mac, this catalog is normally where macOS mounts local attached disks
```bash
/dev/disk5s2 on /Volumes/Import bilder (apfs, local, nodev, nosuid, journaled, noowners)
/dev/disk6s1 on /Volumes/Backups (apfs, local, nodev, nosuid, journaled, noowners)
```
## Version 1.8.0 (build 90) - 18 December 2023

Important: **all** functions within every view are now icons on the toolbar, upper right. Major functions are colored blue.

The following changes in release are:

- fixed some issues regarding adding ssh keypath, file and ssh port number 
	- there is a check on the format which kicks in right away, the check is now debounced a few seconds to allow entering data 
- even more cleanup in code after removing support for previous versions of macOS
	- there is always some code in a large codebase which should be revised and cleaned up
- and even more views are converted to `NavigationStack` and most functions moved to the toolbar
	- this makes the views cleaner and more space for important info
	- **all** sheet and pop-up views are removed, only Alert as pop-up if some odd situation occurs like missing either source or destination when adding tasks
	- within every view the main icon (function) is colored blue and a short help text is displayed when hoover mouse over icon

Update of user documentation is commenced, it might take some more time because most screen dumps are changed and text need updates. 

## Version 1.7.9 (build 89) - 7 December 2023

Updated 8 December 2023, the timer and automatic execution of tasks are disabled and this version is uploaded to Homebrew as well. 

From this release, RsyncUI is **only supported on macOS Sonoma**, the latest release of macOS. This also includes the RsyncUI version on Homebrew. With every new release of SwiftUI and macOS, there are several new features that are also beneficial for RsyncUI. The result is that the macOS Sonoma version of RsyncUI includes enhancements not found in the other version. And it is difficult to maintain two releases of RsyncUI; there are too many `#avaliable` statements in the code, which makes the code more vulnerable to bugs.

New features:

- RsyncUI is now supported on macOS Sonoma only
- RsyncUI now starts as a single window app, closing the window also closes the app
- the toolbar functions are now adjusted for which navigation is enabled, either sheet views or `NavigationStack`
- after abanding support for previous versions of macOS there are several cleanups in code
- navigation by `NavigationStack` is default on, switch off in usersettings for sheet views and pop-ups
- automatic execute tasks after estimate and the timer function are disabled
	- any automatic function introduces some risks for failure, better *safe than sorry*

**A minor issue**: *sometimes* when RsyncUI estimates tasks and there is data to synchronize, choosing to synchronize data after estimate only returns to the previous view without synchronizing. You will discover when this happens, just do another estimate and synchronize data after estimating. Sometimes there is a mismatch by the UUID (uniq identifier) selected for synchronizing data and UUID on task. I dont know why this sometimes happens, it might be a bug.  The guard statement just bails out if it happens, just do another estimate and synchronize.

###  Last version  supporting previous versions of macOS - 1.7.5 build (88)

The relase 23 November 2023 were the last releases of RsyncUI supporting macOS Montery and macOS Ventura, macOS 12 and 13. Next release will be for macOS Sonoma only. This also applies for the Homebrew version as well.

## Version 1.7.8 build (88)  and 1.7.5 build (88) - 23 November 2023

Both versions will run on macOS Sonoma, but one is built for macOS Sonoma only. And by the release of version *1.7.8 b(88)* and *1.7.5 b(88)* the macOS includes a few more enhancements than the other version. There are two versions because of the new `@Observable` macro introduced in Swift 5.9, Xcode 15 and macOS Sonoma. 

Enable  `NavigationStack` by switch on in user settings, save and restart RsyncUI. Disable it by switch off, save and restart.

- *Version 1.7.5 b(88)* supports all macOS versions from macOS Monterey and is available from Homebrew as well
- *Version 1.7.8 b(88)* for **macOS Sonoma** only

There are some GUI changes in both apps.  And a couple of minor fixes. There are several methods for navigation within SwiftUI, and one method is utilizing `NavigationStack`. Enable `NavigationStack` is by settings and it is default off. All sheets, like pop up views, are for *the macOS Sonoma only* version converted to new Navigation if enabled. For *the Homebrew* version only for macOS 14 users and only the Tasks view including estimating details. 

See more info about it [here](/post/navstack/).

### OSLog

OSLog, a unified logging system developed by Apple, is implemented in both versions. If you want to verify or just see what RsyncUI is executing of commands for `rsync`, you can in this release, use the Console app to verify the commands. Please see more info about OSLog in [the built](/post/Built/) documentation.

## Version 1.7.7 build (87)  and 1.7.4 build (87) - 31 October 2023

*Version 1.7.4 build(87)* supports all macOS versions from macOS Monterey and is available from Homebrew as well.  

*Version 1.7.7 build(87)* for **macOS Sonoma** only and only by direct [download](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/releases/download/v1.7.7/RsyncUI.1.7.7.dmg) from GitHub. This version is for macOS Sonoma only because of migrating objects and bindings to the new `@Observable` macro introduced in Swift 5.9, Xcode 15 and macOS Sonoma. 

There is, by the search field, in some of the views possible to filter the output. Within the logs and restore view filter by any string. In the previous releases, the filter might be observed as a kind of not working properly if there are many rows of data. This is due to the list of data is refreshed on every keypress in search field. And by every refresh, the list of data is computed. In the this version there is a one *second debounce* or delay in refresh. By the delay, typing in the search field is smoother.  The 1 second delay in *filter search* is notified by a rotating progressview.

And there are some other minor updates as well.

## Version 1.7.3 build (86) - 19 October 2023

Changes as for the macOS Sonoma build, but built for macOS Monterey to macOS Sonoma. Major difference for this version compared to the macOS Sonoma only, is the bindings introduced in Swift 5.9, the `@Observable` macro. 

*Version 1.7.3 build(86)* supports all macOS versions from macOS Monterey and is available from Homebrew as well.  

## Version 1.7.6 build (86) - 19 October 2023

For **macOS Sonoma** only and only by direct [download](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/releases/download/v1.7.6/RsyncUI.1.7.6.dmg) from GitHub. This is a maintenance release. 

There are some minor fixes and the major work is replacing the ShellOut package with an updated and maintained package. The ShellOut in the released version of RsyncUI is not working. The ShellOut let the user execute shellscript ahead and after execution of a synchronization task. A shell script might be like moving files, mounting a filesystem from a remote server and so on. The ShellOut must be used with care and most likely only the advanced macOS users with experience in writing shellscripts might find this feature usefull. 

## Version 1.7.5 build (84) - 28 September 2023

For **macOS Sonoma** only and only by direct [download](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/releases/download/v1.7.5(b84)/RsyncUI.1.7.5.dmg) from GitHub.

The major work in this release is migrating objects and bindings to the new `@Observable` macro introduced in Swift 5.9, Xcode 15 and macOS Sonoma. Migrating code to the new macro is a *breaking change* and that is why there are two builds.  This version only supports macOS Sonoma. 

*Version 1.7.2* supports all macOS versions from macOS Monterey and is available from Homebrew as well.  

## Version 1.7.2 build (85) - 23 September 2023

This is a maintenance release. Build by Xcode 15 for macOS Monterey to macOS Sonoma. There are no bugfixes (none reported), some enhancements only and a few cleanups in code. 

- there is a change in restore for snapshot task, either select to restore from a previous snapshot or default the latest
- on macOS Sonoma, to delete a task, log or snapshot select and use the ⌫ (backspace)
	- the delete from the Edit menu does not work on *macOS Sonoma*
	- the delete works as expected on macOS Ventura and Monterey 
 
## Version 1.7.1 build(83) - 1 September 2023

The following are enhancements of RsyncUI, minor updates which makes the app easier to use.  Some of the changes are utilizing SwiftUI modifiers for table operations like *copy*, *paste* and *delete*. By utilizing modifiers for table, default menu functions are automatically enabled for all three table operations. 

 For macOS 12 and later:
 
 - profile is moved to the toolbar, it makes the navigation stack more clean
 - delete tasks from main- and add view is updated to use function from Edit menu (deleted from Tasks menu)
 - delete logrecords from within Log listings view from Edit menu
 - fixed error message about missing files for new users, if missing file default files are created
 - added automatic execution when all tasks are estimated
 	- user set seconds before execution and function can be disabled, *disabled* by default
 	- select the button counting down to *temporary* disable
 
For macOS 13 and later:

- from the Edit menu the shortcuts `⌘C` and  `⌘V` will copy and paste copies of the selected tasks. 

The copy and paste will append task(s) to make it more easy to create new task based upon existing data. Data as source, destination, server, username and parameters to rsync are copied from the selected task(s).

## Version 1.7.0 build(82) - 16 August 2023 

There is tooltip for each function on the toolbar. MacOS Monterey does not support double click on row, see [how to execute](/post/macos12/)  a `--dry-run` on macOS Monterey. The RsyncUI documentation is updated and more updates will be done after this release. 

- there is a cleanup in main taskview, if a task is executed after any estimation a progressbar will be presented
- some adjustments in logs- and restore view
- some of the functions are moved the toolbar
- color of the buttons are adjusted

## Version 1.6.6 build(81) - 1 August 2023 

This is a maintenance release. Minor cleanups, bug fixes and enhancements in parts of the code. 
 
- task are marked when estimated
- new button for display rsync output on estimated task
	-	remeber first double click estimate a task, next double click will execute the estimated task
- huge output (more than 20000 lines) from rsync is truncated and notified
	- summary of rsync output is appended to truncated output
- enable and disable checking for error in output from rsync
	- errors in output from rsync is notified
- and some cleanup and minor fixes.

## Version 1.6.5 build(80) - 16 July 2023

This is a maintenance release.  No enhancments but a few cleanups and bugfixes. RsyncUI will become the primary application this year (compared to RsyncOSX). RsyncOSX will still be maintained, but bugfixes only. According to Apple, SwiftUI is the future and RsyncUI is developed by utilizing SwiftUI. And on macOS 13 RsyncUI is already more feature rich than RsyncOSX.

## macOS Sonoma and RsyncUI

I have commenced porting RsyncUI to macOS Sonoma and Swift 5.9. By Swift 5.9 the new `Observable` macro replace the  `@StateObject` propertywrapper. This is a *breaking* change and there will be two releases for RsyncUI when macOS Sonoma is public. Combine is still used in parts of the macOS Sonoma version of RsyncUI. The port of RsyncUI to macOS Sonoma is almost completed. 

## Version 1.6.3 build(79) -  29 June 2023

The release includes some important fixes for *administration* of snapshots. There are also some enhancements for macOS 13 and later:

- for **macOS 13 and later** a double click on row executes a `--dry-run`
	- the next doubleclick will **execute** the task, RsyncUI verify if previous doubleclick was a `--dry-run`, if not a new `--dry-run` is executed
	- only **avaliable for macOS 13** and later due to SwiftUI requirements, the DryRun button is removed if macOS 13 and later
- after a  `--dry-run` it is now possible to execute task direct or by a new doubleclick
- when executing a `--dry-run` and initate execute after shows a view of progess
	- version 1.6.1 will only execute the task and show a rotating progress until the task is completed
- some of the rotating progress and position on screen is slightly changed
- fixes of critical issues in administration of snapshots

## Version 1.6.1 build(77) -  20 June 2023

*Non critical issues* in version 1.6.0 are fixed.

## Version 1.6.0 build(76) -  16 June 2023

Update **19 June 2023**: there are a couple of *non critical issues* which cause some functions like `--dry-run` within the main view not working **after** a synchronize all execution of tasks. Fixes are done in code and an update will be released in a  day or two.

There are several minor GUI changes like all `list` and `foreach` listing are replaced with `table`.  There are also a new log of major synchronize actions. Select  the shortcut `⌘O` for view logfile and select actions. The restore part is changed a little bit. 

And as always there are some cleanup in code. 

## Version 1.5.0 build(73) - 4 May 2023

There is a change within the internals for navigation. RsyncUI supports macOS from version 12.0. From macOS 13.0 Apple has deprecated the [NavigationView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/navigationview) and released [NavigationSplitView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/navigationsplitview). Within this release there is now a check if macOS 13 and [code](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/blob/main/RsyncUI/Views/Sidebar/SidebarVentura.swift) for navigation is refactored. The deprecated [code](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/blob/main/RsyncUI/Views/Sidebar/Sidebar.swift) for navigation still works for macOS 12, but new code is simpler when there is complex navigation.

This version also includes a very simpel timer function to postspone synchronization of data **while you are working**.  The timer is **not** like a schedule function.  The timer is working if RsyncUI is minimized and your Mac is not going to sleep. The visual count down of minutes might not be correct if RsyncUI is minimized, but the internal count down is correct. This is due to the *timer library*  require the app to be active.

RsyncUI writes a record to the log every time it executes a profile by the timer. The timer has to be reactivated after each time.

There are also a few minor cleanups as well.

## Version 1.4.8 build(70) - 24 March 2023

There are cleanup and refactor of the main tasks view, internal code only. There are also two GUI updates:

- after an estimate it is now possible to execute task direct
- there is a list of all tasks for all profiles sorted by last run date from the main tasks view

## Version 1.4.7 build(69)  -  14 March 2023

Update 17 March 2023: 

- RsyncUI is now avaliable to install by Homebrew: `brew install --cask rsyncui`

The following are new:

- the restore part for `snapshot` tasks is modified, restore is from last snapshot only, **no** changes for normal `synchronize` tasks
- the actual restore command is presented in Restore view (might be copied and pasted within a terminal)
- there is a update of GUI for `DryRun` in main Tasks view

No bugfixes, only a few minor enhancements

## Version 1.4.5 build(67) -  7 March 2023

The following are new:

- the estimated view, changed to a table view
- the position navigation items within the navigation bar  is now fixed, e.g. does not change vertical position when a new sidebar action is selected
- create and delete profile is a by a button (from Add task view)
- the restore part is refactored, mostly internal code

## Version 1.4.3 build (65) - 8 February 2023

This is a maintenance release.

- fixed one non critical bug
- some cleanup in code and a few minor GUI updates
- this is a maintenance release

## Version 1.4.2 build (64) - 6 January 2023

Compiled on Apple Silicon (M1 Pro) by Xcode 14.2 as a Universal macOS Binary on macOS Ventura

There are some minor updates and some internal cleanups in this release, nothing big at all. There is added an simple assist function in add task. The parameters to rsync view is enhanced, if the `verify` switch is on the Verify button executes a verify command.  And likewise for `synchronize` and `restore` switch. All verify commands are `--dry-run` commands.

**Caution**: regarding the Verify button and the `verify` switch is on. If there are many files a verify will take some time due to rsync computes the checksum and compares each files by checksum.

{{< figure src="/images/rsyncparameters/verify.png" alt="" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

## Version 1.4.0 build (62) - 6 December 2022

Compiled on Apple Silicon (M1 Pro) by Xcode 14.1 as a Universal macOS Binary

Some enhancements and a bugfix in this release.

Parameters to rsync:

- any changes to parameters are presented "on the fly", add or delete a parameter and the updated rsync command is presented
- the changed rsync command might be verified (by a `--dry-run`) ahead of saving

Estimate and details:

- in main view select `Estimate` button without selecting a task
    - after closing the summarized estimated view, select a task and the details (`--dry-run`) is presented
    - select another task and the details is presented
    - the `Reset` will reset all estimates, likewise if tasks er executed after estimate will reset all estimates.
    
And there is a bugfix in [Quick Synchronize](https://rsyncui.netlify.app/post/quicktask/).

## Version 1.3.9 build (57) - 18 November 2022

Compiled on Apple Silicon (M1 Pro) by Xcode 14.1 as a Universal macOS Binary

There are a few changes and fixes to the snapshots and the parameters to rsync parts of RsyncUI. Changes are:

- snaphots: fixed a few bugs, the first and last snapshot are not possible to delete even if they are marked for delete, during delete process they are removed from list of delete if tagged
- snapshots: tagging and select for delete are moved to shortcut actions and menu actions
- parameters to rsync: if default parameters are marked for delete the actual parameterlist presented is updated, changes has to be saved to take effect

## Version 1.3.8 build (56) release candidate - 10 November 2022

Compiled on Apple Silicon (M1 Pro) by Xcode 14.1 as a Universal macOS Binary

There are a few changes and fixes to the snapshot part of RsyncUI. The changes are as applied to the snapshot part of RsyncOSX. This is a release candidate and will be released as an new version in a couple of weeks.

## Version 1.3.7 build (56) - 5 November 2022

Compiled on Apple Silicon (M1 Pro) by Xcode 14.0 as a Universal macOS Binary

There is fixed a minor bug when selecting a task and hitting the shortcut `⌘R` for excute task now. The task is executed but the spinning progresswheel did not disappear when task was completed. It is now fixed.

## Version 1.3.6 build (55) - 31 October 2022

Compiled on Apple Silicon (M1 Pro) by Xcode 14.0 as a Universal macOS Binary

The major work in this release is rewriting some of the code to utilize Swifts async and await for asynchronous execution of code. The new code utilizing async and await is much simpler to read and write. The need for callback functions are reduced and it makes code lesser.  Lesser code is better code. Asynchronous execution is a key part of RsyncUI. The completion of a task is not known ahead of execution and whenever a task is completed next action is executed. Next action is e.g. execute next synchronization task, present output from rsync or present a list of files. 

The main view is also changed a little bit, see [the changed main view](/post/tasks/).

## Version 1.3.0 build (53) - 30 September 2022

Compiled on Apple Silicon (M1 Pro) by Xcode 14.0 as a Universal macOS Binary.

- removed "Select and slide to left for delete" a task, to delete a task select it and delete either by shortcut `⌘D`(in Synchronize view) or by menu
- new shortcut `⌘I`(in Synchronize view) for getting status about local and remote data


## Version 1.2.9 build (52) - 8 September 2022

Compiled on Apple Silicon (M1 Pro) by Xcode 14.0 as a Universal macOS Binary.

This release is built on macOS  Ventura. There are some minor GUI enhancements.

## Version 1.2.8 build (51) - 20 March 2022

Compiled on Apple Silicon (M1 Pro) by Xcode 13.3 as a Universal macOS Binary.

- the Execute buttons within main view is one button now, in user config enable always estimate first
  - if not set RsyncUI will execute tasks with no estimation
  - shortcuts for estimation and execution works as expected

## Version 1.2.7 build (50) - 17 March 2022

Compiled on Apple Silicon (M1 Pro) by Xcode 13.3 as a Universal macOS Binary.

This is a primarily a maintenance release.

- there are a few changes within log records
  - search and filter
  - removed a button
- within the restore view there is a new search facility
- the userconfig is now saved as JSON file, automatically transferred from the previous PLIST config file
  - userconfig are values like which version of rsync is utilized, restore path and so on

## Version 1.2.6 build (48) - 31 December 2021

Compiled on Apple Silicon (M1 Pro) by Xcode 13.2.1 as a Universal macOS Binary.

RsyncUI is slowly, but steady becoming better and more user friendly. RsyncUI is stabel, most of the core functions are based on code from RsyncOSX. There are no plans for major changes, but more like minor enhancements when I discover parts which should be improved.

- delete a task by shortcut `⌘D` (in Synchronize view)
- updated a few labels
- some minor updates as well

## Version 1.2.5 build (48) - 6 December 2021

The following are [changes](/post/newversion/) within this version:

- multiple tasks and single task view is merged into one view
- the new task view includes some reorganization of functions
  - estimate and execute all tasks or selected tasks
  - execute all tasks (no estimation) or selected tasks
  - estimate one task, execute task after estimation or cancel, view detailed output from rsync
- a few buttons are removed, functions in buttons are moved to shortcuts
- there is a new first time start view

## Version 1.2.3 build (46) - 11 November 2021

Compiled on Apple Silicon (M1 Pro) by Xcode 13.1 as a Universal macOS Binary.

Localization for German and Norwegian added. Added GUI panels for selecting catalogs to synchronize.

## Version 1.2.2 build (45) - 28 October 2021

The issues **below** is solved in this version.

I have just got my new Apple Silicon based MacBook Pro 14" with the new M1 Pro processor. The path for the installation of Homebrew on Apple Silicon Mac´s is changed. And there is an issue in changing path for rsync in RsyncUI. Homebrew on Apple Silicon based Mac´s installed in `/opt/homebrew/bin/`.

RsyncUI should also detect if on a Apple Silicon or Intel based Mac.

And  there is also an annoying error messages if a not valid path for `rsync` and restore is set.

## Version 1.2.1 build (42) - 21 October 2021

Build by Xcode 13.1 RC

The major work is internal. There might be several hundred or thousands of logrecords. Reading and loading logrecords into memory is moved to when they are needed. And not when the app is started or a new profile is selected. The change will improve memory footprint and speed up the application.

The default profile is automatically selected at start of application.

Localization to German, Italian and Norwegian is **not** yet added. There was some issues in localization and it is removed for the moment. Most of strings are already translated into German and Norwegian.

## Version 1.2.0 build (41) - 28 September 2021

The issue in Update configurations is fixed. There was also a issue with labels (prompts) in textfields which is fixed.

## Version 1.1.2 build (40) - 9 September 2021

This build includes some minor UI tweaks in toggle buttons (see [settings](/post/normalsettings/)). The docs are updated with screenshots. This is most likely the last update before macOS Monterey is relesed. A new build, version 1.2.0build (41) will be released as soon as Apple release macOS Monterey and Xcode 13.

## Version 1.1.2 build (39) - 1 September 2021

The schedule part of app is removed. The majority of users dont use scheduling. This is the experience from RsyncOSX and the download statistics. In about 2000 downloads of RsyncOSX only 80 is the scheduling app.

## Version 1.1.2 build (38) - 28 August 2021

- a few minor UI enhancements
- no bugfixes

And the QA and work on the UI continues.

## Version 1.1.2 build (37) - 21 August 2021

- redesign of rsync parameters UI, [split into parameters and default parameters](/post/rsyncparameters/)
- fixed a couple of bugs in rsync parameters as well

The QA and work on the UI continues, still not happy with some of the views.

## Version 1.1.2 build (28)

There is 29 June 2021 [released](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/releases) version 1.1.2 of RsyncUI. There are two builds, one for macOS Big Sur and one for macOS Monterey.

At start of the macOS Big Sur version select, from the drop down, either the "Default profile" or other profile if used. This is **not** required on RsyncUI on macOS Monterey. RsyncUI on macOS Monterey picks the default profile when selecting a task.

- RsyncUI conforms [the App protocol](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/app)
- the UI is cleaned up a bit
- several internal changes
- RsyncUI adapts to some changes in macOS settings

The localization of RsyncUI is somewhat refactored. For the moment RsyncUI is localized to German and Norwegian, and there are a few strings missing in the release candidate.

## Version 1.1.1 build (27)

**Update 17 June 2021**. The builds are removed for the moment.

There is 4 June 2021 [released](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/releases) version 1.1.1 of RsyncUI. The following is fixed in this release:

- refactored parts of decode and encode JSON, Combine is a super framework
- refactored a few other parts as well
- SwiftUI require some computed properties, like UUID, on data
  - these properties are added during reading data, by mistake these properties was also written to file
  - this is now fixed and the filesize, specially the logs file, is reduced

## Prerelease version 0.99 build (22)

There is 28 April 2021 [released](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/releases) a release candidate of RsyncUI and RsyncSchedule, the menu app for executing scheduled tasks.

- split two "busy" UIs into two views, schedules and rsync parameters

There is some more info about [how to setup RsyncOSX utilizing JSON](https://rsyncosx.netlify.app/post/json/). The `About` for both RsyncOSX and RsyncUI shows in bottom of view, where the data is saved. Default catalog for storing files for both apps is:

$HOME/.rsyncosx/macserialnumber/
```
