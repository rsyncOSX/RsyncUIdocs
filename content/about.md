My name is Thomas, e-mail: <thomeven@gmail.com>, and I am the developer of RsyncOSX and RsyncUI. The development of **RsyncOSX** commenced early in 2016 as a personal project to learn Swift. The first release of RsyncOSX on GitHub was March 2016. And there has been a ton of changes since then. [^1]. 

[^1]: The start of development was a project to learn Swift. And there has been a lot of learning. Major parts of the current codebase of RsyncOSX is rewritten at least a couple of times compared to the first versions. Learning is an evolving process and even if some codelines does the work does not mean they are correct.

The work on the *SwiftUI* based **RsyncUI** commenced late in 2020. Many of the basic Swift components are shared between the two apps.[^2]

 [^2]: SwiftUI is a declarative programming paradigm vs Swift´s imperative paradigm. SwiftUI is a language for declaring the GUI´s (views) and that is why RsyncOSX and RsyncUI looks are very different. RsyncOSX is a Storyboard application where all GUIs are designed and connected with the approriate Swift files. 
 
I have a master degree in computing science, but I am **not** a professional developer. I did my master in the days when Linux was released in 1991 and Internet became a public service. And a few years ahead of that, in 1989, the Web was invented at Cern.   

RsyncOSX and RsyncUI are not professional software. There is one developer only, me, and I am doing what I can to keep the applications as stable and user friendly as possible. Nor am I a UI designer and some user might find the UI complicated and less user friendly. The maintenance of RsyncOSX and RsyncUI will be one of my hobbies. As long as there are users of the apps I will continue the maintenance.  If you like using RsyncOSX or RsyncUI please consider giving me a star on the GitHub repository. Every single star is a motivation for me to continue developing and keep the apps updated for the latest version of macOS.

I have retired from work at the age of 62. I am a passionate [photographer](https://photosbythomas.netlify.app/), nature and wildlife (birds) and love staying in the Norwegian mountains. Grand kids, photography, continue maintenance of my macOS applications and cross country skiing are keeping me busy.
