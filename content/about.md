My name is Thomas, <thomeven@gmail.com>, and I am the developer of RsyncOSX and RsyncUI. The development of **RsyncOSX** commenced early in 2016 as a project to learn Swift. The work on the SwiftUI based **RsyncUI** commenced late in 2020 after some thoughts about what next? Should I learn a language like TypeScript and develop a multiplattform version of RsyncOSX or continue on the Apple plattform.

I did some research about multi plattform development, but I did not manage to find out what should be the right tools for such an application. After some careful thinking I decided stay on the Apple development plattform with Xcode, Swift and SwiftUI. SwiftUI is an amazing framework. I have also learned about another amazing framework, Combine.

I have a master degree in computing science, but I am **not** a professional developer. I did my master in the days when Linux was released in 1991 and Internet became a public service. And a few years ahead of that, in 1989, the Web was invented at Cern.   

RsyncOSX and RsyncUI is not professional software. There is only one developer, me, and I am doing what I can to keep the applications as stable and user friendly as possible. I am not a UI designer and some user might find the UI complicated and less user friendly.

The development of RsyncOSX and RsyncUI will continue to be one of my prioritized hobbies. As long as there are users of the apps I will continue developing.  If you like using RsyncOSX or RsyncUI please consider giving me a star on the GitHub repository. Every single star is a motivation for me to continue developing and keep the apps updated for the latest version of macOS.

I have retired form work at the age of 62. I am a passionate photographer, nature and wildlife (birds) and love staying in the Norwegian mountains. Grand kids, photography, continue maintenance of my macOS applications and cross country skiing are keeping me busy.
