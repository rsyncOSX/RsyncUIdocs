My name is Thomas and I am the developer of RsyncOSX and RsyncUI. The development of **RsyncOSX** commenced early in 2016 as a project to learn Swift. The work on the new **RsyncUI** commenced late in 2020 after some thoughts about what next? Should I learn a language like TypeScript and develop a multiplattform version of RsyncOSX or continue on the Apple plattform.

I did some investigating about multiplattform development and I did not manage to find out what should be the right tools for such an application. After some carefull thinking I decided stay on the Apple development plattform with Xcode, Swift and **SwiftUI**. SwiftUI is an amazing framework. I have also learned about another amazing framework, **Combine**.

Learning is important for me. It is important to keep your mind sharp. I have a masters degree in computing science, but I am **not a professional developer**. I did my master degree in the days when Linux was released in 1991 and Internet became a public service. And a few years ahead of that, in 1989, the Web was invented at Cern.   

For the moment I am a senior advicer at a university. I will, early in 2022 at the age of 62, retire from work. When I am retired I will spend more time with grand kids, photograpy and continue working on developing my macOS applications.

RsyncOSX and RsyncUI is **not** professional software. There is only one developer, me, and I am doing what I can to keep the applications as stable and userfriendly as possible. I am not a UI designer and some user might find the UI complicated and less userfriendly.

The development of RsyncOSX and RsyncUI will continue to be one of my prioritized hobbies. A long as there are users of it I will continue developing.  If you like using RsyncOSX or RsyncUI please consider giving me a star on the GitHub repository. Every single star is a motivation for me to continue developing and keep the apps updated for the latest version of macOS.

## Me

This is me on a cross country ski trip in the Norwegian mountains in April 2021. Another, for me, important activity is [outdoor life in the Norwegian mountains](https://toppturer.netlify.app/), summer and winter.
